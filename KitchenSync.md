# KitchenSync is an ActionScript 3.0 library for sequencing animations and other time-based actions. #

## KitchenSync was designed with developers in mind ##
KitchenSync was designed for developers who want a smart way to handle animation or other time-based functionality with code. Written from the ground up in ActionScript 3.0, KitchenSync relies on smart object-oriented architecture rather than complicated shorthand. It includes a number of features and shortcuts, such as the `clone()` method, that save effort for developers. KitchenSync makes extensive use of events and informative runtime errors and is quite flexible when it comes to extending the functionality.

## KitchenSync is more than an animation library ##
KitchenSync is more than an animation library. [Tweens](KSTween.md) are a major part of KitchenSync but that is not the end. It also allows you to sequence [sounds](KSSoundController.md), [functions](KSFunction.md), and [event dispatches](KSDispatchEvent.md) among other [actions](AbstractAction.md). The framework is open-ended allowing you to come up with new ways to work with the [virtual timeline](Synchronizer.md).
