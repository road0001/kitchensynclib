### Q. Why should I use KitchenSync? ###
A. Here are [20 reasons](http://dispatchevent.org/mims/ks-20reasons/)

### Q. What is the file size of KitchenSync? ###
A. The size of KS depends on how much of the library you use in your project. By my calculations, the entire library, including all the easing functions, is around **18KB**, however, it's unlikely that your project would use all of the classes. For simple tweening with sequences and limited easing functions, the size is closer to **10KB**.

### Q. What are the terms of use (license) for KitchenSync? ###
A. KitchenSync is released under the MIT License. Though not required **the authors humbly request that you let us know when you use it and mention KitchenSync in the credits of your applications**.
