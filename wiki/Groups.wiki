= Introduction =
Action Groups are special types of actions that contain sets of other actions which can be controlled simultaneously. All action groups extend the `AbstractSynchronizedActionGroup` class. 

= Details =
The `AbstractSynchronizedActionGroup` class defines common characteristics of all action groups. All action groups use the `addAction()` method to add actions to the group. As you can see from the figure, `AbstractSynchronizedActionGroup` is itself a subclass of `AbstractSynchronizedAction` allowing you to nest action groups within other action groups or use a group as if it were a single action. This distinction makes creating long strings of time based events a relatively simple task.
