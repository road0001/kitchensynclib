#summary Help for legacy users.

This page is here to help you when there have been conversions that affect legacy code. The most recent one is the change between v1.1 and v1.2. 

To convert from 1.1 to 1.2 or later, I suggest that you 
  * search for the old names of classes and replace them with the new class names
  * replace Synchronizer.initialze with KitchenSync.initialize.
  * replace imports for com.mimswright.sync.*; with org.as3lib.kitchensync.*; and org.as3lib.kitchensync.action.*; (you probably won't need access to the other packages)
  * replace imports for com.mimswright.easing.*; with org.as3lib.kitchensync.easing.*;
