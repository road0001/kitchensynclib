#summary An action to call a function and retrieve its results.

==Summary==
The `KSFunction` class represents a function or method and any specified arguments that are to be called at a specified time or after some delay. Just pass in the function you want to call and any arguments. The function will be called when the action executes.

==Syntax==
*Note:* unlike earlier versions of !ActionScript, with AS3 there is no need to use a delegate to retain the scope of the function.

===Getting results of a synchronized function===
If the function called by a KSFunction object returns a result, that result will be stored in the KSFunction as an untyped object. To access it, use the `result` property.
{{{
var getSumFunc:KSFunction = new KSFunction(1000, getSum, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
getSumFunc.start();

// LATER....

var sum:Number = Number(getSum.result); // 15
}}}
