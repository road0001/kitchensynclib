=Actions=
KitchenSync is made up of several types of objects that perform some kind of function and are timed by the Synchronizer. These objects are called _actions_. All actions are subclasses of the abstract class `AbstractAction`. 

Descendants of !AbstractAction can be found in the `org.as3lib.kitchensync.action` package.
