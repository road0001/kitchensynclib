#labels Actions
==Summary==
Perhaps the most used action is the Tween. A tween is an object that represents a change of a property from one value to another over time. However, in most cases, the word tween is more likely to be synonymous with an animation be-*tween* two key points. A tween object has a target object (usually a display object) whose properties are affected, a target property, a duration, a start value and an end value. Tweens also use a special type of function, called an [Easing easing function], to determine the interpolation from the start to the ending values.

==Syntax==
{{{
new Tween(target:Object, property:String, toValue:Number, fromValue:Number = EXISTING_FROM_VALUE, duration:* = 0, offset:* = 0, easingFunction:Function = null);
}}}
  * `target` - the object whose property will be changed.
  * `property` - the name of the property to change. The property must be a Number, int or uint such as a `Sprite` object's "alpha"
  * `toValue` - the target value to tween the property to.
  * `fromValue` - the starting value of the tween. By default, this is the value of the property before the tween.
  * `duration` - the time in frames that this tween will take to execute.
  * `offset` - the time to wait before starting the tween.
  * `easingFunction` - the function to use to interpolate the values between fromValue and toValue.
