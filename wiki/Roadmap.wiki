==Goals==

*KitchenSync aims to...*
  * offer a well-architected, extensible framework for working with time-based animations and events.
  * take advantage of the power of ActionScript 3.0 while using OOP best practices and design patterns ~~and without requiring the Flex framework~~.
  * respond to the needs of developers with a rich set of features.
  * be a full-featured library for animation and timeline based actions. 
  * make thorough documentation as important as new functionality.

Furthermore, this project was designed to be used by you the developer. Any ideas or suggestions from its users will be considered.

===Version 1.0 *_Complete!_*===
  * Set up core functionality.
  * Tackle the most common needs of library users including tweens and timed functions.
  * Release the library open source on Google Code.

===Version 2.0===
  * Analyze the other major tweening libraries in detail.
  * Attempt to match the strongest features of the other libraries.
  * Fix any outstanding bugs from version 1.0

===Version 3.0 and beyond===
  * There is a backlog of additional features that I hope to add in future versions.
