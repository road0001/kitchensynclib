#summary About the API Reference.
=API Reference=
The API Reference documents all of the packages, classes, and methods of the KitchenSync library. It is created using [http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/201/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=LiveDocs_Book_Parts&file=asdoc_127_1.html ASDoc] and checked in to the repository at least every stable incremental release. You can find the documentation in the repository under the /docs folder or hosted at [http://kitchensync.as3lib.org/docs/].

Also, be sure to check the [Manual] for help.
