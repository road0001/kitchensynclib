==Summary==
A Staggered [ActionGroups group] of actions will execute one after the other in a sequence however, the actions are separated by a specified time (e.g. 1 second) rather than the end of the previous action.

==Syntax==
{{{
new KSStaggeredGroup(stagger:*, ... children)
}}}
  * `stagger` - The time to wait between each child's execution. Can be an integer or a string which follows the [Timing#Parsing_time_strings time parsing rules].
  * `children` - The remaining parameters are added as child actions (if they are AbstractAction instances)
