#labels Actions,Incomplete-Example
==Summary==
The `SynchronizedFunction` class represents a function or method and any specified arguments that are to be called at a specified time or after some delay. Just pass in the function you want to call and any arguments. The function will be called when the action executes.

==Syntax==
*Note:* unlike earlier versions of !ActionScript, with AS3 there is no need to use a delegate to retain the scope of the function.
