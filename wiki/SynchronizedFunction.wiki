The `SynchronizedFunction` class represents a function or method and any specified arguments that are to be called at a specified time or after some delay. Just pass in the function you want to call and any arguments. The function will be called when the action executes.

Note that unlike earlier versions of !ActionScript, with AS3 there is no need to use a delegate to retain the scope of the function.
