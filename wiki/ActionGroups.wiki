= Summary =
Action Groups are special types of [AbstractSynchronizedAction actions] that contain sets of other actions which can be controlled simultaneously. All action groups extend the `AbstractSynchronizedActionGroup` class. 

= Details =
The `AbstractSynchronizedActionGroup` class defines common characteristics of all action groups. All action groups use the `addAction()` method to add actions to the group. As you can see from the figure, `AbstractSynchronizedActionGroup` is itself a subclass of [AbstractSynchronizedAction `AbstractSynchronizedAction`] allowing you to nest action groups within other action groups or use a group as if it were a single action. This distinction makes creating long strings of time based events a relatively simple task.

The types of groups are:
  * [Sequence]
  * [Parallel]
  * [Staggered]

Groups can be used in conjunction with one another. For example, you may wish to create a [Sequence sequence] that contains a [Parallel parallel] action so that you can have several actions occur at the same point in a sequence.

With all of the action groups, separate events are dispatched upon completion of individual items and of the entire group.
