An ActionScript 3.0 Event can be dispatched after a delay or as part of a sequence using a `SynchronizedDispatchEvent` object. Events are dispatched using the AS3 event dispatching system and can be sent from the `SynchronizedDispatchEvent` itself or from any other `IEventDispatcher` that you specify. The constructor can be passed either an Event object or a string for the event type.
