=!KitchenSync is an !ActionScript 3.0 library for sequencing animations and other time-based actions.=

==!KitchenSync was designed with developers in mind==
!KitchenSync was designed for developers who want a smart way to handle animation or other time-based functionality with code. Written from the ground up in !ActionScript 3.0, !KitchenSync relies on smart object-oriented architecture rather than complicated shorthand. It includes a number of features and shortcuts, such as the `clone()` method, that save effort for developers. !KitchenSync makes extensive use of events and informative runtime errors and is quite flexible when it comes to extending the functionality.

==!KitchenSync is more than an animation library==
!KitchenSync is more than an animation library. [Tween Tweens] are a major part of !KitchenSync but that is not the end. It also allows you to sequence [SynchronizedSound sounds], [SynchronizedFunction functions], and [SynchronizedDispatchEvent event dispatches] among other [AbstractSynchronizedAction actions]. The framework is open-ended allowing you to come up with new ways to work with the [Synchronizer virtual timeline].

==!KitchenSync aims to...==
    * offer a well-architected, extensible framework for working with time-based animations and events.
    * take advantage of the power of !ActionScript 3.0 while using OOP best practices and design patterns and without requiring the Flex framework.
    * respond to the needs of developers with a rich set of features.
    * be a full-featured library for animation and timeline based actions.
