==Downloading KitchenSync Code==
The code for KitchenSync is freely available for download through the Google Code site. There are two basic ways to get the code.
  # Visit the [http://code.google.com/p/kitchensynclib/downloads/list Downloads tab] and download the latest stable build.
  # Use [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] (SVN) to check out the code from the repository through the [http://code.google.com/p/kitchensynclib/source/checkout Source tab]. 

*Note* If you are comfortable using SVN, this is the recommended way to get the source code. The code in the `/trunk` folder is the latest build and may be unstable or have partially implemented features. However, all stable versions are available to download since they will be tagged in the `/tags` folder. If you're not sure what a [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.branchmerge.tags.html tag] is (or have no idea what I'm talking about), I recommend [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ learning all about Subversion] or just downloading the .zip file.
