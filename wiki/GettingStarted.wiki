This document should help you get your first KitchenSync project going.

==Setting up the synchronizer==
Before doing anything else, you'll first need to set up the Synchronizer. The Synchronizer is a utility that dispatches events at every frame and is used as the timing core of KitchenSync. To start the Synchronizer, use the static method `Synchronizer.initialize()` and pass in a reference to any `DisplayObject`. Don't forget to import `com.mimswright.sync.*`! The reference to the `DisplayObject` allows the Synchronizer to communicate with the `stage` so it can listen for events and get the current frame rate. You can also optionally set the frame rate if you want it to be something other than the default. I recommend doing this at the very beginning of your code in your main application file or in your document class.

After this, your Synchronizer is set. Since you don't need to register actions, you probably won't need to access it again but if you do, you can use `Synchronizer.getInstance()`.
