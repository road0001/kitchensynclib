= Introduction =

A tween target is a type of object that represents values being controlled by a tween. These objects are used in conjunction with [KSTween] actions. Tween targets can control simple numeric values like x and y, complex numeric values like colors, values that are complicated to change like filter properties, and even for controlling timeline animations. Having a separate class for setting the values allows us to use a single tween action class for multiple purposes. 

The most common type of tween target is the `TargetProperty` which contains an object and the name of a property of the object.
