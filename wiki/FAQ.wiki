===Q. What is the file size of KitchenSync?===
A. The size of KS depends on how much of the library you use in your project. By my calculations, the entire library, including all the easing functions, is around *18KB*, however, it's unlikely that your project would use all of the classes. For simple tweening with sequences and limited easing functions, the size is closer to *10KB*.
