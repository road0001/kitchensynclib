===Q. What is the file size of KitchenSync?===
A. The size of KS depends on how much of the library you use in your project. By my calculations, the entire library, including all the easing functions, is around *18KB*, however, it's unlikely that your project would use all of the classes. For simple tweening with sequences and limited easing functions, the size is closer to *10KB*.

===Q. What are the terms of use (license) for KitchenSync?===
A. KitchenSync is released under the [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php LGPL License]. Though not required *the authors humbly request that you let us know when you use it and mention KitchenSync in the credits of your applications*.
